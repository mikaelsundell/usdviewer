Introduction
------------

This project is an experimental exploration of USD and eventually MaterialX visualization and interaction using C++ and Qt, serving as an alternative implementation of the usdview application. It acts as a testbed for USD functionality, focusing on real-time rendering, Qt-based UI integration, and performance optimizations. Most of its functionality mirrors the Python-based features found in StageView.py and related classes,  in a native C++ implementation for deeper control and efficiency.
